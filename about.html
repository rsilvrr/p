        <h2><em>Hello</em></h2>
        <p>I'm Ryan. There's really one thing you should know about me: I love making things. <small><small>Except websites.</small></small></p>
        <p>Many years of my childhood were spent creating custom levels in various game engines: namely Torque engine with Marble Blast Gold (2003), and Source engine with...any Valve title. These days, much of my time is spent the same way â€“ except now I have an actual, real commerical game released!</p>
        <p>My primary hobby other than game development is video editing. I currently make videos about the underlying mechanics behind Overwatch. It's the perfect intersection of gamedev and video production.</p>
        <p>Please enjoy the site! Everything shown here was made with a smile. <small><small>Except the site itself. It was made with pain.</small></small></p>
